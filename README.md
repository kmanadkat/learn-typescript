# Typescript Fundamentals

This is based on a Udemy's course [Typescript: The Complete Developer Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide) where [Stephen Grider](https://twitter.com/ste_grider) teaches Typescript in depth along with popular design patterns and buiding complex project.

### Course Notes

- `Typescript` = `Javascript` + `A type system`
- TS Type System is only active _during development_
- It doesn't provide any performance improvement
- Node doesn't understand Typescript, Typescript compiler (`tsc`) compiles it to javascript which then Node or browser can execute
